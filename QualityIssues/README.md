# Voximplant Quality Issues Demo (iOS)

This demo demonstrates quality issue notification functionality of the Voximplant iOS SDK. The application supports video and conference calls between this iOS app and other apps that use any Voximplant SDK.

> This demo application doesn't handle push notifications, so it doesn't receive incoming calls if the application is in the background or killed.

#### Features
The application is able to:
- log in to the Voximplant Cloud
- make a video call
- make a conference call (up to 4 video streams supported)
- receive and display quality issue notifications
- put a call on hold / take it off hold
- enable/disable sending video
- switch camera
